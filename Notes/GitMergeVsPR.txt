# Merge vs PR

As far as history is concerned, there is no difference between a merge and the PR process.

And as far as contribution goes, your contributors will not have to do anything different for the two situations. They are the same (minus the nice little chat).

PRs are not much helpful if there is only a single contributor to a repository.
