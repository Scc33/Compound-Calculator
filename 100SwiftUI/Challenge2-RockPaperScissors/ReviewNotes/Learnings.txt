Picker
 - SwiftUI will turn into a table-based layout where new screens can slide in with choices
 - Very effective forms
NavigationView
 - Can give screen a title
 - Prevents content from going off safe area
 - Can be used to push new views onscreen
@State
 - Used for storing data and Swift uses to know when to updated views (views are structs)
Two Way Binds
 -- TRICKY --
 - $variable
   - used to both read and write values

What is a view?
 - basically everything is a view
 - Color.red, VStack, Group, etc
 - To conform to view protocol all that is needed is a computed property body returning some View

Under the hood
 - under the hood SwiftUI has primitive views
 - these conform to views but return something fixed rather than calling other views
 - Examples:
   - Text
   - Image
   - Spacer
   - Color
