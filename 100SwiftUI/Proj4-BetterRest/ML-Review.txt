ML Review/Overview

Random Forest
 - Similar to boosted trees
 - Each tree only has access to subset of data
 - Reduces risk of overfitting
 - Brings in new ideas

Boosted Tree
 - Uses series of decision trees
 - Subsequent trees refine the errors

Decision Tree
 - Tree structure that contains choices
 - Similar to 20 questions

Linear regressor 
 - Estimate relationships by drawing a straight line (linear equation)
 - Minimize sum of squared error
